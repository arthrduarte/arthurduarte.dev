Since very young I have exposed my thoughts online, both on Twitter and Facebook. 

But I don't have my old accounts anymore. 

Fortunately.

This piece of the web is where I share my thoughts in a long format. 

For anyone who wants to bypass security and have more info, send me a message privately and I'll give you access to the company repository
